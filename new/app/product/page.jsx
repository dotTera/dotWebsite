Temperature, precipitation, and weather patterns influence crop growth and development. Increased temperatures can accelerate evaporation, stress plants, and alter flowering and pollination times. Inconsistent rainfall patterns can lead to droughts or floods, both detrimental to crops. Pests and diseases thrive in certain climates, posing additional risks. Climate change exacerbates these challenges, making adaptation strategies crucial for sustainable agriculture. Overall, a stable and predictable climate is essential for maximizing crop productivity and ensuring global food availability.
